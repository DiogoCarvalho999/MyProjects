## 🌍 Story

In a distant kingdom, where feathers shine under the sun and golden grains are treasures of the land, lies **Frangoland**, the home of free and happy chickens.

But peace is about to be shattered…

The wicked **Witch Frangavery** has cast a dark spell and kidnapped dozens of innocent chickens! Her evil plan? To use them in a forbidden ritual to obtain unimaginable power.

Now, the only hope for Frangoland is **KernelFC**, a fearless hero with unbreakable courage. He must storm the **Cursed Castle** and stop the witch before she completes her dreadful spell.

Traps, puzzles, and shadowy creatures await in every room…  
But **KernelFC cannot fail**.
